# dl4clj-nlp

Clojure library meant to for word embedding using the deeplearning4j.

Currently still in experimental stage and api subject to change.

Pull requests are welcome!

# Usage

To use dl4clj-nlp:
```clojure
(:require '[dl4clj-nlp.core :as nlp])

;;Configure your Word2Vec model
(def w2v (nlp/word-2-vec "path/to/text-file" 
	{:min-word-frequency 5;;You can also input an option map
     :iterations 1		  ;;To set certain parameters
     :layer-size 100
     :seed 42
     :window-size 5}))

;;This trains the model on the data given
(nlp/fit! w2v)

;;Write the word2vec model to memory
(nlp/write-word-vectors w2v "word_vectors.csv")

;;Load a word2vec model from memory
(def w2v-2 (nlp/read-word-vectors "word_vectors.csv"))
```
